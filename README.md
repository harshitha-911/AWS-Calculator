# AWS Calculator Project

## Overview
This project is a web application that leverages AWS services for performing calculations. It includes functionalities such as AWS Lambda functions, DynamoDB database integration, API Gateway for RESTful APIs, IAM for access control, and Amplify for deployment.

## Features
- **AWS Lambda Function:** Utilizes serverless computing to execute specific functions on-demand.
- **DynamoDB Integration:** Stores and retrieves data from a NoSQL database for persistent storage.
- **API Gateway:** Facilitates communication between frontend and backend through RESTful APIs.
- **IAM (Identity and Access Management):** Manages user access permissions and authentication for secure interactions with AWS resources.
- **Amplify Deployment:** Deploys the application seamlessly using AWS Amplify for hosting and continuous deployment.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, API Gateway
- **Deployment:** AWS Amplify
